  <description>
    This extension allows automatic and manual correction of email addresses that are added to your database. i.e. john@hotmai.cpm is corrected to john@hotmail.com.
    You can add, remove, and edit the correction settings under the Administrator -> System Settings -> Email Address Corrector menu.
    Automatic email address correction is enabled or disabled at Administrator -> System Settings -> Email Address Corrector menu. It is disabled by default.
    Existing email addresses aren't affected automatically, and the corrections only take place when they are added, not edited.
    You can correct email addresses that are already in your CRM by using the new search result action "Email - correct email addresses".
    You can also add email domain equivalents to the tool. We found that some contacts were being created when we had an @gmail.co.uk address registered for them, but there was an inbound email from @googlemail.co.uk. This will help prevent duplicate contacts.
