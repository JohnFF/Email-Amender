  <description>Automatic correction of email addresses that are added to your database. i.e. john@hotmai.cpm is corrected to john@hotmail.com. 
  You can add, remove, and edit the correction settings under the Administrator -> System Settings -> Email Amender menu. 
  Settings are added automatically upon install, and removed upon delete. 
  Existing email addresses aren't affected, and the corrections only take place upon edition, not editing. 
  Automatic correction has to be enabled after install.
  You can also add email domain equivalents. We found that some contacts were being created when we had an @gmail.co.uk address registered for them, but there was an inbound email from @googlemail.co.uk. This will help prevent duplicate contacts.
