    Existing email addresses aren't affected automatically. Corrections only take place when email addresses are added, not when they are edited.
    You can correct email addresses that are already in your CRM by using the new search result action "Email - correct email addresses".
    You can also add email domain equivalents to the tool. We found that some contacts were being created when we had an @gmail.co.uk address registered for them, but there was an inbound email from @googlemail.co.uk. This will help prevent duplicate contacts.
    The email addresses were selected based on Future First's experience of common email errors.
